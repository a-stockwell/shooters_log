# CIDM 6330 Spring 2022 Final Project

## Milestone 1

This is following along with the code from "Architecture Patters with Python" book. 

The goal of this project is to start building a shooters log for tracking performance and long term goals. This will currently be targeted toward the sport of United States Practical Shooting Association style of competition. 

## Project refactor

After looking at the project with Dr. Babb, the scope of the project is changing. To simplify the project the goals and steps will be removed. Code will be commented out for possible future use. A runs object will be added to the project to track information on individual runs for the shooter, the athlete class. This should help simplify the project and the tests that need to be written for completion. The Domain model will need to be updated and added to this document for reference.
